Shiraz is the capital city of the Fars province and also the capital during the <b>Zand (1747-1779)</b> dynasty, but it is truly renowned for its famous wine called <b>Syrah</b>. It is a bit ironic to have such a famous wine from a country where alcohol is prohibited. It is also the gateway for anyone wishing to visit <b>Persepolis</b>.

It was early morning when I got to Shiraz on a night bus from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>. The journey was fairly confortable for what you can expect from a night bus. I was little bit tired but nothing that stopped me from heading straight away looking for a place to sleep and explore the beautiful city of <b>Shiraz</b>.

<b><highlight><middle>Shiraz is a very laid back and beautiful city in Iran. Easily one of my highlights.</middle></highlight></b>

Only after checking a couple of places that I had already in mind I could finally find a cheap place to stay. <b>Seven Hostel</b> offered a great opportunity with a room with shared bathroom for only 15€ a night. The hostel also has a nice restaurant and the staff is very friendly.

My first stop was the <b>Shah Cheragh Shrine</b>, where the brother of <b>Imam Reza</b> rests. The shrine is absolutelly stunning with mirrors and tiles that will leave anyone speechless. The shrine is very busy during the day, but mostly at night, where families go together to pay their respects. Note that you've to dress modestly, no shorts/shirts and women should wear a <b>Chador</b> which is provided at the entrance of the shrine. Guides are also available for free.

I spent some time during the day but mostly at night at this beautiful shrine. It is a great opportunity to meet and talk to locals, or just sit down and observe the ancient rituals.

The next day started very early because I booked a place on a tour to <b>Persepolis</b>, 60km northeast of Shiraz. This is something that everybody should have a guide for, it helps so much understanding much of the ruins still standing. It is really crowded, and if you visit on a sunny day like I did, please help yourself with plenty of water and enough shade.

The tour turned out to be very expensive (~40€ with transport and guide included), but I really think that it helped to have such an wonderful guide with us all the time while there. I booked at my hostel but everybody in Shiraz should be able to offer you a ride there, just be alert for scams from taxi drivers.

The Persepolis tour should leave you with enough time in the afternoon to explore some of the beautiful mosques in the center, given that you don't choose to go to Necropolis after Persepolis. It is not cheap to visit these religious sites, because prices are a lot higher for tourists and you can easily spend 4€+ for each mosque.

The first one that I visited, and I don't really recommend for what you pay, is the highly rated <b>Vakil Mosque</b>. There are <b>tons</b> of beautiful mosques in Iran that are really wonderful pieces of art, but this one is defenitely not one of them.

Alternatively, head out of the mosque and stroll around the beautiful <b>Vakil Bazaar</b> and be amazed by the variety of goods being sold here. You can find almost anything you need and even you don't need here!

The north side of the city, crossing the river, is also worth spending some time exploring. This is were you can visit the <b>Tomb of Hafez</b> (very popular among locals), the <b>Shiraz Art University</b>, <b>Azadi Park</b> but most importantly, the stunning <b>Ali Ibn Hamza Mausoleum</b>.

The best advice I can give, which happened to me by pure coincidence, is to stay for the afternoon/evening prayer inside the complex. Just sit down and enjoy the prayer call, all the busy people getting ready for the cerimony, free tea and LOTS of smiles and kindness. I can't stop bragging about the Iranians kindness, it is trully something to admire.
