Jerusalem is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions — <b>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</b> It is the claimed capital city of both Israel and Palestine, although almost all foreign embassies to Israel are located in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/TelAviv" target="_blank">Tel Aviv</a></b>, and the foreign missions to Palestine are located in Ramallah which is the de-facto capital).

The bus from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/TelAviv" target="_blank">Tel Aviv</a></b> dropped me off at the old city gate, which was very convenient in order to get to my hostel located in the Old Town. I stayed at the <b>Jaffa Gate Hostel</b>, one of the budget options inside the Old Town, and paid ~50€ for a Private Double room with Shared Bathroom. I can highly recommend this place because of its location and friendliness of the owners that are always available to help you in whatever issue that you might have. The room is basic but clean, and you'll have awesome night on a 500+ year old house!

Jerusalem is by no means a cheap city, but still better value for money than <b><a href="{{site.url}}/TelAviv" target="_blank">Tel Aviv</a></b>. The city also has a religious and ancient vibe with pilgrims from all over the world coming here to pray and fulfill their promises.

<b><highlight><middle>Jerusalem rivals with Varanasi as the most unique places in the world that I've been to.</middle></highlight></b>

It's easy to reach every major sight by foot in the old town. There are 4 major quarters in the old town and each of them is more unique than the other; there's a Christian/Muslim/Jew/Armenian quarter each one with shops/restaurants providing unique goods. On the Christian quarter you can visit the <b>Church of the Holy Sepulchre</b> (also the end of the <b>Via Dolorosa</b>), the most holy Christian spot in the world. It's painfully crowded and I didn't even got the chance to go inside the tiny tomb chamber. The lines seem to queue for hours, from morning to night.

A few meters away from the <b>Church of the Holy Sepulchre</b> you can find the mighty <b>Temple Mount</b>, with the <b>Western Wall</b> at the base of it. This wall is the last remaining part of the sacred Second Jewish Temple built by Herod the Great 2000 years ago, and it remains the most sacred place of Judaism.

The Wall's plaza is open 24/7 and you'll mostly see people praying and sometimes celebrations as well. The place is heavily guarded, but you're free to wander around as you wish, just be aware that this is the most sacred place for Judaism, so have everybody should show some respect.
