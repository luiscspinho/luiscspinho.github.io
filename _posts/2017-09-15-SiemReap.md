Battambang is the second most populous city in Cambodia. It lacks beaches and downtown buzz, but it also does not suffer from congested traffic, mass tourism and touts. The colonial architecture can be seen at every corner and it is here that you can find the Cambodia's most famous circus (Phare Ponleu Selpak).

<b><highlight><middle>The fact is that there is nothing much to do in Battambang.</middle></highlight></b>
