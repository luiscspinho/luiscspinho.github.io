I arrived by train in <b>Hué</b> after my amazing journey in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/TamCoc" target="_blank">Tam Coc</a></b>. It was the only time that I travelled by night train in Vietnam and I must confess that the train is <b>very very</b> confortable with a bed/sheets/pillow available. My cabin was for 4 people. It is quite expensive when compared with bus tough, almost double the price so the next night trips I decided to do them by bus despite all the fuzz about being dangerous. I was never afraid during any trip.
