Phnom Penh is the capital and the most populous city of Cambodia. Once known as the <i>Pearl of Asia</i>, it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s.

I got in Phnom Penh after a long day trip from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/HCMC" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh City</a></b> in Vietnam. It was almost night when the Giant Ibis bus left us by the night market entrance, near the river. From there to the place I booked, <b>Velkommen Guesthouse</b>, it was only a 5 min walk. I got a double room for 14$ a night without breakfast. The location is great, the young guys working there are great, but there is not much going on, so if you're looking for a social place to stay this is not your best option.
