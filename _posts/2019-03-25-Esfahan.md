Esfahan is the top touristic destination in the whole Iran and for a good reason. The city that was once called <i>Isfahan nasf-e jahan</i> which literally means <i>Isfahan is half the world</i>, a naming that everybody should relate to when first visiting the city. It is also home to the most friendly and hospitable people in the country, without a shadow of a doubt!

I came to Esfahan on a public bus from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Varzaneh" target="_blank">Varzaneh</a></b> early in the morning. My hostel (Seven Hostel) was located in the city center, so I had to take a <b>Snapp</b> to get there. Seven Hostel is not really a hostel like the other <i>Seven's</i> around the country, it is more of an hotel. However, although not perfect, for the price with breakfast included I thought it was a good deal. The people on the reception are also friendly and will help you with anything.

The stunning mosques in Esfahan are among the most beautiful and interesting in the world, and for a good reason. I found them to be very expensive for tourists, but in retrospective, you're seing some of the more unique architecture and history of the world, and that doesn't come cheap.

My first stop was the city bazaar with the <b>Hakim Mosque</b> as its gem. Right in the middle of the shops, it's one of the oldest mosques in Esfahan.

It is impossible to not be amazed by the spectacular <b>Naqsh-e Jahan Square</b>, the focal point of Esfahan. Built in 1602, the square contains two mosques, a palace and a bazaar. It is the second largest public square in the world and it is very popular for picnics or to just people watch in general.

The two mosques in the <b>Naqsh-e Jahan Square (Imam Mosque / Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque)</b> are, arguably, two of the most beautiful mosques in whole Iran. They're absolutely stunning, specially at night, and deserve that everyone take their take to contemplate them.
