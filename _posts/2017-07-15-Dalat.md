I actually didn't go directly from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/HoiAn" target="_blank">Hội An</a></b> to Đà Lạt because I did a quick stop (1 night) in <b>Nha Trang</b>. However, I will not make a post about the city because I don't think it is worth it. Nha Trang is flooding with Russian tourists and even the restaurants menu has a page written in Russian, something very unique that I only saw here.

The place I stayed in was a little bit shady to say the least. We were moved to the hotel in front of the one we booked in and our booking was canceled because we <i>"didn't show up"</i> (this way we can't make a review on the website). However their transportation to Đà Lạt was spot on. <b>HOTEL NAME HERE</b>

The beach is what makes Nha Trang a tourist destination. But when I was there, well... I'll just leave this here:

Needless to say that I was out of there the next morning.
