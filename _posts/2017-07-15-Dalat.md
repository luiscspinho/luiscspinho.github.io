I actually didn't go directly from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/HoiAn" target="_blank">Hội An</a></b> to Đà Lạt because I did a quick stop (1 night) in <b>Nha Trang</b>. However, I will not make a post about the city because I don't think it is worth it. Nha Trang is flooding with Russian tourists and even the restaurants menu has a page written in Russian, something very unique that I only saw here.

The place I stayed in was a little bit shady to say the least. We were moved to the hotel in front of the one we booked in and our booking was canceled because we <i>"didn't show up"</i> (this way we can't make a review on the website). However their transportation to Đà Lạt was spot on. <b>HOTEL NAME HERE</b>

The beach is what makes Nha Trang a tourist destination. But when I was there, well... I'll just leave this here:

Needless to say that I was out of there the next morning.

The ride from Nha Trang to Đà Lạt takes approximately 3-4 hours and the bus will leave you in downtown. From there we just walked to <b>Nguyen Minh Hostel</b> where we ended up staying for <b>X NIGHTS</b>. A cheap place (10$ double bed with breakfast) that had the most <i>painful</i> bed ever.

Đà Lạt is a big draw for domestic tourists, because of the French influence architecture, it is a well known destination for honeymoons. <i>Le Petit Paris</i> it is called, although I'm not sure that you can call this place a romantic destination, at least by european standards. The city centre is quite small, feels very urban, and some buildings are in disrepair. However, if you move a little away from the centre you'll find spacious landscapes, coffee plantations etc.
