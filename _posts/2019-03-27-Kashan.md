Kashan is a city very close to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b>. Many travellers bypass Kashan on their journeys through the country, and even though I had the time to visit it, I can totally understand why. Kashan is nice, but nothing spectacular like the more touristic <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b> / <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Yazd" target="_blank">Yazd</a></b> / <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Shiraz" target="_blank">Shiraz</a></b>.

I must say that the weather when I was there was not the best, but the city still didn't had the impact like others had in me. Sure there are beautiful and unique houses, and they're the main reason to visit Kashan, but that's about it.

Kashan is small enough to walk to most of the main sites. When the bus left us in Kashan, it was pretty straightforward to get to our accomodation, <b>Hostel Green House</b>, a cozy but nothing fancy hostel. It did the job, but that's about it.
