excerpt: "Kashan is a city in the Isfahan province best known for its famous historic houses. Its charm is thus mainly due to the contrast between the parched immensities of the deserts and the greenery of the well-tended oasis."

Kashan is a city very close to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b>. Many travelers bypass Kashan on their journeys through the country, and even though I had the time to visit it, I can totally understand why. Kashan is nice, but nothing spectacular like the more touristy <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b> / <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Yazd" target="_blank">Yazd</a></b> / <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Shiraz" target="_blank">Shiraz</a></b>.

I must say that the weather when I was there was not the best, but the city still didn't have the impact like others had in me. Sure, there are beautiful and unique houses, and they're the main reason to visit Kashan, but that's about it.

Kashan is small enough to walk to most of the main sites. When the bus left us in Kashan, it was pretty straightforward to get to our accomodation, <b>Hostel Green House</b>, a cozy and nothing fancy hostel. It did the job, but that's about it.

On my first day in Kashan, I went to explore the famous historical houses and finished the day with a <i>sunset tour</i> that my hostel proposed. This tour was actually very enjoyable, we visited the local <b>Jameh Mosque</b>, a historical house where women were working with clay and finally to watch a typical Iranian dance being rehearsed at night.

When it comes to the famous historical houses of Kashan, honestly, I didn't find them particularly amazing like the fame they have. Sure, they've some charm, but if you're coming to Kashan expecting to see something out of the ordinary, I think you'll be let down.

They're also not free, and certainly not cheap for tourists. At the end of the day you'll have spent as much if not more what you pay to visit the stunning mosques of <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b>, which I don't think that anyone can compare the value between them.

One last thing to do before heading out of the city, is to visit <b>Abyaneh village</b>, 80km away from Kashan. The village is well known for its distinctive red hues and benched construction of traditional mud brick houses. The culture of Abyaneh has been largely preserved, with the few hundred residents speaking Middle Persian and dressing in traditional clothing.

There are no local buses that run to <b>Abyaneh</b> though, you'll have to hire a car like I did. Every hostel should help you with this along with getting other travelers to split the costs of the journey.

Kashan will definitely not be in my top 5 destinations or experiences in Iran. Since I had the time I didn't mind at all to stop there on my way up to the north, but if I had to detour just to stop there on purpose, I would be disappointed.

<b><highlight><middle>Kashan will not be on my found memories of best experiences in Iran.</middle></highlight></b>

My next destination would be the incredible <b>Alamut Valley</b> in the mountains north of <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>. To get to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>, it's really easy with an hourly bus that departs from the Kashan's bus station. From <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>, there are also hourly buses to <b>Qazvin</b>, where we got a pick up to our guest house in the mountains.


<br>
<h1>How to get there and away</h1>
<ul>
<li>Local bus from <a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a> to Kashan, should take ~2.5 hours and departs from the North bus station. I took a Snapp to get there.</li>
<li>Local bus from the Kashan's bus station to Tehran, and from there to Qazvin. From here we took a pick up to our guest house.</li>
