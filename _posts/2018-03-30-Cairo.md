Cairo is Egypt's largest city and its capital with a population of over 20.4 million. The streets are chaotic at rush hours and the metro can also be over populated. The overcrowded places are not as bad as in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Delhi" target="_blank">New Delhi (India)</a></b>, but they're not too shabby either. It is also the more <i>relaxed</i> city in Egypt, where many women wear denim jeans on a more <i>weasternish</i> fashion.

I flew in from Porto with the intent of spending 2 weeks in Egypt. The capitals, usually, are not the most appealing for me, but I must say that I became very impressed with Cairo. The metro allows for an easy navigation through the city and you have tons of interesting stuff to visit and not only the usual boring shopping/museum stuff...
