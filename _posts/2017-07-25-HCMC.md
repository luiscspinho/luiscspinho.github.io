I actually didn't go directly from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/HoiAn" target="_blank">Hội An</a></b> to Đà Lạt because I did a quick stop (1 night) in <b>Nha Trang</b>. However, I will not make a post about the city because I don't think it is worth it. Nha Trang is flooded with Russian tourists and even the restaurant's menu has a page written in Russian, something very unique that I only saw here.
