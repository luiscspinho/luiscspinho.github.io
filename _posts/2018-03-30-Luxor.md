Cairo is Egypt's capital and largest city with a population of over 20.4 million. The streets are chaotic at rush hours and the metro can also be over populated. The overcrowded places are not as bad as in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Delhi" target="_blank">New Delhi (India)</a></b>, but they're not too shabby either. It is also the most <i>relaxed</i> city in Egypt, where many women wear denim jeans on a more <i>westernish</i> fashion.
