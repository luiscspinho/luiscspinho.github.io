Yazd is another of the <i>don't miss</i> destinations in Iran. Without the world class sights of Esfahan or <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Shiraz" target="_blank">Shiraz</a></b> the city presents winding lanes with mud brick houses to create a unique atmosphere for every visitor.

<b><highlight><middle>Personally, I thought that Yazd was very overrated.</middle></highlight></b>

The night bus from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Shiraz" target="_blank">Shiraz</a></b> to Yazd arrived at the bus station ahead of time, which meant that I couldn't get much sleep. The bus station is well outside the city, which meant that walking to my hostel was not a possibility. Fortunately there are always local buses and I got one that was filled with local young students on their way to school. It was probably 6 in the morning.

The local bus didn't stop in the center, nothing that I was not really expecting, so I had to walk a little bit until I reached <b>Yazd Star Hostel</b>, a cheap and new hostel near all the main attractions. The staff working there doesn't seem to have a lot of experience with tourists, so it wasn't a perfect stay, however the room and the breakfast were very good.

Straight away after checking in I went on foot to explore what Yazd had to offer. The town is small and it's very easy to reach every corner by foot.
