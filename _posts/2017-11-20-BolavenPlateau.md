The <b>Bolaven Plateau</b> is an elevated region in southern Lao, and it is known for its cool climate, numerous waterfalls coffee plantations. A lot of ethnic groups made their homes in the region, Laven (Bolaven means ‘Home of the Laven’) being the largest one. Several other Non-Khmer ethnic groups, including the <b>Alak</b>, <b>Katu</b>, <b>Tahoy</b> and <b>Suay</b>, also live on the plateau.

After some days of relaxation in the <b><a href="{{site.url}}/4000Islands" target="_blank">4000 Islands</a></b>, I was ready for new adventure, so I stoped in Pakse to start riding the <b>Large Loop</b>, 320km splitted in 3 days.
