The <b>Bolaven Plateau</b> is an elevated region in southern Lao, and it is known for its cool climate, numerous waterfalls coffee plantations. A lot of ethnic groups made their homes in the region, Laven (Bolaven means ‘Home of the Laven’) being the largest one. Several other Non-Khmer ethnic groups, including the <b>Alak</b>, <b>Katu</b>, <b>Tahoy</b> and <b>Suay</b>, also live on the plateau.

After some days of relaxation in the <b><a href="{{site.url}}/4000Islands" target="_blank">4000 Islands</a></b>, I was ready for a new adventure, so I went to Pakse, the starting point to the <b>Bolaven Plateau Large Loop</b>, 320km of huge coffee plantations, waterfalls, farmland, ethnic diversity and miles of excellent roads, splitted into 3 days.

It is important to take some considerations before doing this trip. First, be careful where you rent your motorbike and be sure that it is in good condition. If necessary, take it for a small ride before, just to be sure that the motorbike is in good condition. I would also recommend that you take an extra chain lock with you, just to be sure. I've read some reports from people that had their motorbike stolen even when using the chain lock that the renter gave them. You'll have to pay for a brand new motorbike if it gets stolen. To guarantee this money, people that rent motorbikes tend to ask for your passport during the lenght of your trip. It doesn't matter if it is illegal or not, it is how it works over there.

You should also bring some warm clothes with you, because despite Lao being a very warm country, the Plateau becomes very cool at night. This is the reason, along with volcanic soil, why the coffee beans of Lao are known across the globe. Also, you should have a rough idea of where you'll be sleeping each night. There is a lot of places along the way where you can stop, but I chose to stay in <b>Tad Lo</b> (<b>Fandee Guest House</b>) 1 night and the other one near <b>Tad Alone / Tad Couple</b> waterfalls. I was supposed to stay in <b>Tad Saulin Homestay</b>, but they were asking for 15$ each person for a tent, so I said <i>'no'</i> and went further to find a much better place for ~10$ a double bed room.

I stayed in a place called <b>Nang Noi Guesthouse</b> in Pakse and I can totally recommend them. I stayed 1 night before going to the <b>loop</b>, rented a motorbike in perfect condition (only 8000km), left my backpack in there while in the <b>loop</b>, another night when I finished the <b>loop</b> and my night bus ticket to <b>Vientiane</b>. I recommend you to send an email at least 1 day before getting there because they can be fully booked due to their popularity.

<b><highlight><middle>So let's start, shall we?!</middle></highlight></b>

My goal on the first day was to reach <b>Tad Lo</b> and visit all the available waterfalls on the way, before sunset. There are people leaving Pakse everyday for the <b>loop</b>, which means that the sooner you get to the places, the better chance you have to get the best price/quality room available. Try to always get to where you'll be sleeping before sunset, that's what I did.
