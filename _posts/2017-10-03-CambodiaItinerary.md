I spent 2 weeks in Cambodia between 11th November and 26th November 2016. I travelled as a couple and always slept in Hostel/Bus.

This itinerary is my personal taste and I didn't use any kind of agency to book anything. I mostly used the internet to search for some logistics regarding transportation. I also used the South East Asia edition of Lonely Planet but you don't really need any guide book because it's <b>easy</b> to travel in Cambodia. Just ask at the reception of your hotel/hostel about how to get to any place and you'll have everything in place for the next day.

<li><b><a href="{{site.url}}/PhnomPenh" target="_blank">Phnom Penh </a></b>(3 days, local bus to Kep)</li>
<li><b><a href="{{site.url}}/KepKampot" target="_blank">Kep & Kampot </a></b>(2 days in Kep and 2 days in Kampot, minivan from Kep to Kampot. From Kampot I got a minivan to Sihanoukville and a ferry boat from there to Koh Rong Samloem)</li>
<li><b><a href="{{site.url}}/Samloem" target="_blank">Koh Rong Samloem </a></b>(3 days, ferry boat to Sihanoukville and a night bus from there to Battambang)</li>
<li><b><a href="{{site.url}}/Battambang" target="_blank">Battambang </a></b>(1 day, local bus to Siem Reap)</li>

<b><highlight><middle>&emsp;Flight, train and bus...</middle></highlight></b>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Flight:</b>
	<ul>
		<br><li>
		I didn't travel by plane in Cambodia.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br><li>
	<b>Train:</b>
	<ul>
		<br><li>Cambodia has no railway network available.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br><li>
	<b>Transportation:</b>
	<ul>
		<br><li><b>Phnom Penh:</b> I was left at the entrance of the night market, very close from where I was going to stay. The main bus stand is very close, so to get a ticket to Kep I just walked and bought it there.</li>
		<br><li><b>Kep & Kampot:</b> I'm not sure that there is a main station where all the buses/vans stop in Kep. I asked the bus driver to stop near the place where I was going to stay, and just walked there. In order to get to Kampot, I got a minivan from my place to the Kampot <i>centre</i>. To get to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Samloem" target="_blank">Koh Rong Samloem</a></b> I got a minivan from my guest house to Sihanoukville, and then a ferry boat from the pier to the island.</li>
        <br><li><b>Koh Rong Samloem:</b> There is only 1 pier on the east side of the island. Go there to get the ferry boat again to Sihanoukville. From the Sihanoukville's pier you can buy a bus ticket to almost anywhere in Cambodia. I got a night bus from there to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Battambang" target="_blank">Battambang</a></b>, stopping in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/PhnomPenh" target="_blank">Phnom Penh </a></b>to switch buses. <b>Don't let the driver keep your ticket!</b> He kept mine (by accident) and I almost got in trouble when I switched buses.</li>
        <br><li><b>Battambang:</b> I don't think it is worth to stop here. I just stayed here for 1 day and immediately got a bus to Siem Reap. It's very easy to find bus companies around downtown by just walking around.</li>
        <br><li><b>Siem Reap:</b> I went to <b>4000 Islands</b> in Lao from here. It is a ~10h journey since you leave Siem Reap until you set foot on one of the many islands in Lao. I used <b>AVT (Asian Van Transfer)</b> service, starting in Siem Reap, stopping 1-2h for lunch, transportation to the border, another van from the other side of the border and finally a boat to your desired island (<b>Don Det / Don Khon</b>).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<b><highlight><middle>&emsp;Costs:</middle></highlight></b>
<ul>
<li><b>~16€ per day, all included.</b></li>
</ul>
&emsp;This includes all kind of daily expenses, rooms (between 6-15€ double room / tent), food (between 1-3€ local food mostly), entrance tickets (40$ in Siem Reap), transportation (bus, ferry and minivan), etc...

<b><highlight>Visa:</highlight></b>
<ul>
<li>It is very easy to get the Cambodian Visa if you're crossing the border by land. Just fill the form that will be handed to you with your basic information, pay the visa fee in Dollars (this depends on your nationality), pay the 2$ stamp exit/entry fee (this is a <b><i>bribe</i></b> and you can try to contest, some people had some success), and just wait for your passport.</li>
</ul>

<b><highlight><middle>&emsp;Highlights:</middle></highlight></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Phnom Penh</b>, Killing Fields of Choeung Ek.</li>
<li><b>Kep & Kampot</b>, grab a motorbike and explore the Bokor National Park all the way to the casino on top.</li>
<li><b>Koh Rong Samloem</b>, relax on one of the most beautiful beaches you'll ever see.</li>
<li><b>Battambang</b>, walk around downtown, I guess? I really didn't like the city.</li>
<li><b>Siem Reap</b>, explore the Angkor Wat temples complex by bicycle!</li>
