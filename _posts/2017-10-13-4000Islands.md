The journey to Lao soil wasn't an easy one. Long, long trip on a mini van full of people without air conditioning and a scorching sun that made an old man pass out in the middle of the road. We stopped near the border to exchange some money and fill the visa form. We ended up spending a lot of time waiting for our passports in the border. It is a little bit stressing to be in <i>no man's land</i> without your passport, but in the end everything will end up fine.

The trip from the border to the <b>Nakasong</b> pier it's only ~18km. Once you get there, you need to walk to the pier and say that the name of the island where you want to go. <b>Don Det</b> and <b>Don Khon</b> are the two major destinations, where all the accomodation and sights are.



<b><highlight><middle>Cycling through the beautiful landscape of Angkor Wat was definitely my best experience in lao.</middle></highlight></b>



<br>
<h1>How to get there and away</h1>
<ul>
<li>From <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Battambang" target="_blank">Battambang</a></b> to Siem Reap it's only a ~3.5 hours bus journey.</li>
<li>From Siem Reap to 4000 Islands I used the Asia Van Transfer (AVT), and for 25$ I had everything arranged from Siem Reap to Don Khon. Expect 1 full day on the road.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>What to do/see</h1>
<ul>
<li>Explore ALL the temples that Angkor Wat has to offer! My favourite was the mysterious Bayon!</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>Where to sleep</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Baphuon Villa</b>, 12$ double bed per night. The young staff is very nice and you've trustable tuk-tuk drivers working for them, as well as bicycles to rent.</li>
</ul>
