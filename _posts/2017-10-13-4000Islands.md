<h1>How to get there and away</h1>
<ul>
<li>From <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Battambang" target="_blank">Battambang</a></b> to Siem Reap it's only a ~3.5 hours bus journey.</li>
<li>From Siem Reap to 4000 Islands I used the Asia Van Transfer (AVT), and for 25$ I had everything arranged from Siem Reap to Don Khon. Expect 1 full day on the road.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>What to do/see</h1>
<ul>
<li>Explore ALL the temples that Angkor Wat has to offer! My favourite was the mysterious Bayon!</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>Where to sleep</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Baphuon Villa</b>, 12$ double bed per night. The young staff is very nice and you've trustable tuk-tuk drivers working for them, as well as bicycles to rent.</li>
</ul>
