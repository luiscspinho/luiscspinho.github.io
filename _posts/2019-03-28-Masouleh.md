Masouleh is one of Iran's most famous villages among locals. It has some unique architecture, where buildings are interconnected and courtyards and roofs both serve as pedestrian areas similar to streets. It is also the only city in Iran, where motor vehicles are not allowed to enter.

It's not easy to getting here independently though. When I decided to come to this lovely town I was in the <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Alamut" target="_blank">Alamut Valley (Zarabad)</a></b> and I had already arranged a driver to get me to <b>Qazvin's</b> bus station. From here I went by bus to <b>Rasht</b> (3 hours) where I got a shared taxi to <b>Fuman</b>, walk 2km until I reached the final shared taxi station to <b>Masouleh</b>.

It was already night when I finally got to Masouleh. I had no accomodation arranged when I got into town, because it's common practice for everybody to arrange their accommodation with local people in town. I ended up staying at the house of the local bread baker on the first night, but it was terrible, so we checked out first thing in the morning and went to look for a better place.

I think that 2-3 hours is enough to explore Masouleh, but since I had a long journey to get there, I stayed for 1 full day to rest up and absorb the local vibe. Not much going on though.

In order to get out of Masouleh you'll have to get the same transportation that you got to get here. This means a shared taxi to <b>Fuman</b>, another shared taxi to <b>Rasht</b> and finally a bus to <b>Qazvin</b>. I got another bus from here to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>, so if you're doing something similar to what I did, try to get out of Masouleh as early in the morning as possible.

<h1>How to get there and away</h1>
