Qom, home of the magnificient <b>Fatima Masumeh Shrine</b>, is a holy city between <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b> and <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b> and it's the second holiest city in the whole country, after <b>Mashad</b>.

Discreet behaviour is particularly needed when walking around the <b>Fatima Masumeh Shrine</b>. There are a lot of senior ranking clerics of Shia Islam living in Qom, and its schools were once revered as the best in the country, including the largest Theology school in Iran. If you're not a muslim you can't enter the shrine without a guide.

I visited Qom on a day trip from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>. There are frequent buses from the south terminal and it should take ~2 hours. The bus station in Qom is very central, so you'll be able to walk everywhere.



<br>
<h1>How to get there and away</h1>
<ul>
<li>Private driver from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Alamut" target="_blank">Alamut Valley (Zarabad)</a></b> to the <b>Qazvin</b> bus station. From here take a local bus to <b>Rasht</b> and then a shared taxi to <b>Fuman</b> where you'll have the shared taxis to Masouleh.</li>
<li>Basically it's the same but the other way around.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>What to do/see</h1>
<ul>
<li>Walk on the small alleys and house's rooftops/courtyards.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>Where to sleep</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Private houses</b>, ask around and try to haggle the best you can.</li>
</ul>
