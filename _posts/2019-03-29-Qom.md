Qom, home of the magnificent <b>Fatima Masumeh Shrine</b>, is a holy city between <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b> and <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b> and it's the second holiest city in the whole country, after <b>Mashad</b>.

Discreet behavior is particularly needed when walking around the <b>Fatima Masumeh Shrine</b>. There are a lot of senior ranking clerics of Shia Islam living in Qom, and its schools were once revered as the best in the country, including the largest Theology school in Iran. If you're not a Muslim you can't enter the shrine without a guide.

I visited Qom on a day trip from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>. There are frequent buses from the south terminal and it should take ~2 hours. The bus station in Qom is very central, so you'll be able to walk everywhere.

Only in Qom I felt how religious this country can be. The vibe is totally different here from the rest of the touristy parts of the country. Keep in mind that you really need to have wear clothes, especially if you're a woman. Upon entering the holy shrine you'll be inspected and a <b>Chador</b> will be given to the women to dress up. A guide will meet you and show you around. It's completely free though.

It's really easy to get back to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>, just head to where you were left off and get into any bus that stops heading north. If they've available space they'll take you to the south bus station in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b>, where you can get the metro.
