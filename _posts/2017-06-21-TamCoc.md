<b>Tam Coc</b> is best known for its boat rides between the cliffs of the river and through 3 tunnels dug by the river through the peaks. Usually tourists prefer to stay in <b>Ninh Binh</b> as it is bigger and has a wider range of options when it comes to accommodation and food, but after some thought we decided to go straight to <b>Tam Coc</b> from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/CatBa" target="_blank">Cát Bà</a></b>, because we would be closer to the places we wanted to visit. However, if you decide to stay in <b>Ninh Binh</b> you'll only be 6km away, which is not really a big deal since you'll probably rent a scooter to move around <i>(you really should!)</i>.

If you get to <b>Tam Coc</b> by bus, like we did, you'll most likely be left in front of the <b>Tamcoc Backpacker Hostel</b> near the lake. If you've travelled in this part of the world before, you'll be used to these <i>tricks</i> in order to get clients to sleep in places where some people have commissions. I don't trust them so I never stayed in those. If you want a really good Homestay for about ~18$ (double room) I can recommend <b>Chez Beo Homestay</b>, because that's where we stayed for the first 2 nights of our 3 in Tam Coc. This place is a little bit out of town, ~3km through some rice fields, but they have free bicycle retal to make up for it. The place is absolutely stunning, surrounded by huge karsts with a small lake where cute geese come to greet you in the morning! Free breakfast is included in the price and their restaurant is also available for you to have lunch or dinner.
