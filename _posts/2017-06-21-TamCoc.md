<b>Tam Coc</b> is best known for its boat rides between the cliffs of the river and through 3 tunnels dug by the river through the peaks. Usually tourists prefer to stay in <b>Ninh Binh</b> as it is bigger and has a wider range of options when it comes to accommodation and food, but after some thought we decided to go straight to <b>Tam Coc</b> from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/CatBa" target="_blank">Cát Bà</a></b>, because we would be closer to the places we wanted to visit. However, if you decide to stay in <b>Ninh Binh</b> you'll only be 6km away, which is not really a big deal since you'll probably rent a scooter to move around <i>(you really should!)</i>.

If you get to <b>Tam Coc</b> by bus, like we did, you'll most likely be left in front of the <b>Tamcoc Backpacker Hostel</b> near the lake. If you've travelled in this part of the world before, you'll be used to these <i>tricks</i> in order to get clients to sleep in commissioned places. I don't trust these kind of places so I never stayed in one of them. If you want a really good homestay for about ~18$
