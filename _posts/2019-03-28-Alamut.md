The Alamut region is located in the <b>Qazvin</b> province and is famous for the <b>Assassin's Castle</b>, <b>Ovan lake</b> but mainly because of its spectacular nature. It is a trekker's paradise.

Many people go for a day trip, but I think that this is a huge mistake. Spend 2 nights or more in the tiny village of <b>Zarabad</b>, slow down and enjoy the most beautiful mountainous views in Iran. There is only one option to sleep in the village, <b>Seven Guesthouse</b>, the best accomodation experience I <b>ever</b> had while travelling.

The guesthouse is run by a young couple with 2 lovely daughters that moved from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b> to <b>Zarabad</b> recently and built a stunning Ecolodge. At the time of my visit there were only 2 rooms available, with the option to stay in the living room, with 2 shared bathrooms in a really good looking lodge with a fireplace at the center of the room.

You'll be taken care like in nowhere else. You'll have all the meals freshly cooked at a reasonable price, served with an everlasting smile that contaminates everybody. The owner even cooked vegetarian meals at our request! All of this for 40€ for a double, totally worth it.

It's not difficult to get to <b>Zarabad</b>, but it requires some planning. I was in <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Kashan" target="_blank">Kashan</a></b> when I decided to come to <b>Zarabad</b> so I had to get to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a></b> first. From there, it's easy to get a bus to <b>Qazvin</b>. I asked the driver to stop on the roundabout before reaching town, where our pickup driver (arranged through <b>Seven Guesthouse in Alamut</b>) was supposed to meet us. From that point, it shouldn't take more than ~1/2 hours to reach the guest house, through a scenic curvy road.

There's not really anything to do in <b>Zarabad</b> besides hiking. I walked to the <b>Ovan Lake</b> passing through local settlements where agriculture is the main activity of locals. Don't expect to visit the best lake you'll ever see, it's not even close, but nonetheless it is a very enjoyable walk.

On my second day in the <b>Alamut</b> we went to the famous <b>Assassin's Castle</b>. We went on the owner's pickup, were stopped by the police, but made it to the top of the castle. Once there you'll have to hike quite a bit to reach the top, but it's totally worth it. The view is stunning.

In order to get back to <b>Zarabad</b> we hiked quite a bit before getting transportation on the road. It required a bit of negotiation from the owner, but a young guy was kind enough to even stop and wait for us while we had lunch.

As I stated earlier, there's no public transportation in <b>Zarabad</b>, so we had to take a private driver to the <b>Qazvin</b> bus station. Not an enjoyable ride, we had to ask multiple times for the driver to slow down, because he was driving like a maniac through tight roads.
