Kashan is a city very close to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b>. Many travelers bypass Kashan on their journeys through the country, and even though I had the time to visit it, I can totally understand why. Kashan is nice, but nothing spectacular like the more touristy <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Esfahan" target="_blank">Esfahan</a></b> / <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Yazd" target="_blank">Yazd</a></b> / <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Shiraz" target="_blank">Shiraz</a></b>.
