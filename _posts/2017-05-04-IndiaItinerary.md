I spent 1 full month in India between 20th September and 19th October 2016. I travelled as a couple and always slept in Hostels/Trains.

This itinerary is my personal taste and I didn't use any kind of agency to book anything. I mostly used the internet to search for some logistics regarding transportation and also to book train tickets. I used the India's edition of Lonely Planet but I really can't recommend it because it's very outdated and I'm sure that you're better off with a more recent guide book.
