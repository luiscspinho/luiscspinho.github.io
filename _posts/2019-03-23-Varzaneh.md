Varzaneh is located 1.5 hour away from Esfahan and evidence of its 5000-year-old civilization is still very present in the small sleepy town. Usually, this charming village is not on traveller's itinerary of Iran, because the <b>Kerman</b> desert is the most famous desert in Iran, however in Varzaneh you can find not only desert, but also a stunning salt lake!

It is very easy to get to Varzaneh from either Esfahan or <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Yazd" target="_blank">Yazd</a></b>. The mini buses to Varzaneh depart from the <b>Jey Terminal</b> in Esfahan when full and takes about 1.5hour. It doesn't matter where they leave you in town, you can walk everywhere.

I don't think that there are more than 2 options to sleep in the town (as of March 2019, TripAdvisor doesn't say so), so it shouldn't be hard to choose one of them. I ended up staying in <b>Negaar Varzaneh Traditional Guesthouse</b> and I can't recommend this place enough. They provide you with everything you might need during your stay. You can have your meals in the Guesthouse with everybody including the staff, which is a great way to meet people and learn more about Iranians life.

Mohaamad, the owner, is the best. On our second night, there was a groupd of Iranians coming to Varzaneh to enjoy the weekend, so Mohaamad promptly did some calls and arranged us an apartment in town for the night, not too far from the actual Guest House.

In contrary to the rest of Iran, women typically wear white chadors, rather than black ones. There's not an exact reason for why this happens, some say that it dates back to the <b>Zoroastrianism</b>, others that its because of the abundance of cotton in this region, or simply because its more confortable to wear white in the desert rather than black.
