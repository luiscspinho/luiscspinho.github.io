This will be my shortest post ever.

<b><highlight><middle>Vientiane, the capital of Lao, is dreadful and probably the worst city I have ever been to.</middle></highlight></b>

During my 3 month trip only <b><a href="{{site.url}}/Battambang" target="_blank">Battambang</a></b> disappointed me, but Vientiane was another level of boredom. In total I spent 2 days in the capital and I still feel that it was too much. The first day I went exploring, but on the second day I practically didn't leave the hostel because I was just waiting for my train to Thailand.

It was early morning when I got to Vientiane after a night journey from <b><a href="{{site.url}}/BolavenPlateau" target="_blank">Pakse</a></b>. The bus left me in walking distance from the place I had in mind to stay, <b>Sport Guesthouse</b>, a budget place where I was able to get a double room with private bathroom for ~10$. The location is also pretty central, however, I'm not sure that this matters in Vientiane...

On that same day I went to visit <b>Pha That Luang</b>, the national symbol and most important religious monument of the country. This is easily accessible by foot, because the traffic in Vientiane is almost nonexistent when compared to any other city in SE Asia.

When coming back to my Guesthouse, I took a quick detour to see the <b>Patuxai Monument</b>, the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> of Vientiane. It isn't nothing out of this world, but since it is on the way back it is worth stopping by in my opinion.

Needless to say that on the very next day in the morning I was off to <b><a href="{{site.url}}/VangVieng" target="_blank">Vang Vieng</a></b>. I booked the bus at my Guesthouse reception and everything worked out great, the bus ride takes about ~3-4h and you'll be left at the bus terminal which is at walking distance of the centre.
